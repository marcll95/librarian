It argues that the last four decades of military adventurism demonstrates Pyongyang’s consistent, calculated use of military tools to advance strategic objectives vis à vis its adversaries. It shows how recent behavior of the North Korean government is entirely consistent with its behavior over this longer period: the North Korean government’s conduct (rather than being haphazard or reactive) is rational – in the Clausewitzian sense of being ready to use force as an extension of diplomacy by other means. The book goes on to demonstrate that North Korea’s "calculated adventurism" has come full circle: what we are seeing now is a modified repetition of earlier events – such as the Pueblo incident of 1968 and the nuclear and missile diplomacy of the 1990s. Using extensive interviews in the United States and South Korea, including those with defected North Korean government officials, alongside newly declassified first-hand material from U.S., South Korean, and former Communist-bloc archives, the book argues that whilst North Korea’s military-diplomatic campaigns have intensified, its policy objectives have become more conservative and are aimed at regime survival, normalization of relations with the United States and Japan, and obtaining economic aid.</P>

This book argues that Iran’s hostility with the United States remains the major causal factor for its proliferation activities. With the US administration pursuing aggressive foreign policies towards Iran since 2000, the latter’s security threat intensified. A society that is split on many important domestic issues remained united on the issue of nuclear weapons acquisition after the US war in Iraq. Consequently, Iran became determined in its drive to acquire nuclear weapons and boldly announced its decision to enrich uranium, leaving the US in no doubt about its nuclear status.</P>  <P></P>  <P>This book underscores the importance of protracted conflicts in proliferation decisions, and underpinning this is the assumption that non-proliferation may be achieved through the termination of intractable conflicts. The aims of this work are to demonstrate that a state’s decision to acquire nuclear weapons depends largely on its engagement in protracted conflicts, which shows not only that the presence of nuclear rivals intensifies the nuclear ambition, but also that non-nuclear status of rival states can promote non-proliferation incentives in conflicting states inclined to proliferate.</P>  <P></P>  <P>This study will be of great interest to students of Iran, Middle Eastern politics, nuclear proliferation and international relations theory.</P>  <P></P>  <P><STRONG>Saira Khan</STRONG> is a Research Associate in the McGill-University of Montreal Joint Research Group in International Security (REGIS).</P>

Avrum Ehrlich	2009	Routledge			0203873513	English	<P><EM>Jews and Judaism in Modern China</EM> explores and compares the dynamics at work in two of the oldest, intact and starkly contrasting civilizations on earth; Jewish and Chinese. The book studies how they interact in modernity and how each civilization views the other, and analyses areas of cooperation between scholars, activists and politicians. Through evaluation of the respective talents, qualities and social assets that are fused and borrowed in the civilizational exchange, we gain an insight into the social processes underpinning two contrasting and long surviving civilizations.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Identifying and analysing some of the emerging current issues, this book suggests Jewish-Chinese relations may become a growing discipline of import to the study of religion and comparative identity, and looks at how the significant contrasts in Jewish and Chinese national constructs may serve them well in the quest for a meaningful discourse. Chapters explore identity, integrity of the family unit; minority status; religious freedom; ethics and morality; tradition versus modernity; the environment, and other areas which are undergoing profound transformation.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Identifying the intellectual and practical nexus and bifurcation between the two cultures, worldviews and identities, this work is indispensable for students of Chinese studies, sociology, religion and the Jewish diaspora, and provides useful reading for Western tourists to China. </P>

Connolly’s political theory forms a distinct and influential contribution to contemporary debates about the nature and prospects of democratic life in the twenty-first century. His original conceptualisations of pluralism, naturalism, the politics of the body, religion, secularism and his daring incorporation of contemporary neurobiology into political theory and analysis, have opened new paths for intellectual enquiry. Connolly has brought an American tradition of pragmatist political thinking into fruitful conversation with the best of contemporary continental European philosophy and given to both a new energy and focus. </P>  <P></P>  <P>In this edited collection, a distinguished panel of political theorists from both Europe and the US provide a critical and nuanced assessment of his contribution to the discipline, especially in the field of democratic theory. They identify the sources of Connolly’s work, its connections to other ways of thinking about the political and they evaluate his continuing contribution to our understanding of the problems and promises of the present and to our appreciation of what it might mean to fulfil the promise of the democratic way of life. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The final chapter provides space for Connolly himself to reflect on his interlocutors and further develop his conception of a ‘world of becoming’ considering the links between political theory and the science of complexity while focusing on the immediate challenges facing both American and world politics. </P>  <P></P>  <P><EM>Democracy and Pluralism</EM> provides a critical introduction to the work of William E. Connolly and to contemporary debates in political theory encompassing topics such as radical democracy, the body, religion, time and contingency. </P>

These voices reveal the authentic experiences, opinions and emotions of men, women and children. They show that the impression of a uniquely disciplined, regimented, militaristic society, which took root in the Western imagination from the 1890s and which helped bring about the Pacific war of 1941-5, is a gross illusion. </P>  <P>Stewart Lone challenges the long-standing view of prewar Japan as a ‘militaristic’ society. Instead of relying on the usual accounts about senior commanders and politics at the heart of government, he shows the realities of provincial society’s relations with the military in Japan at ground level. Working from the perspective of civil society and both rural and urban life in the provinces, Lone investigates broader civil contacts with the military including schools, local businesses, leisure and entertainment, civic ceremonies and monuments, as well as public attitudes towards the military and its values. </P>  <P>This book will be of interest to upper undergraduates, postgraduates and academics interested in military history and Japanese history.</P>

It examines topics of central importance to our understanding of the literary field in France in the period, such as: the close relationship between politics and literature; the historical, political, cultural and personal legacies of the First World War; the so-called ‘crisis of the novel’ and the attempt to create and develop new narrative forms; the phenomenon of Russian emigration to Paris in the wake of the Russian Revolution and Civil War; the possibilities for the creation of a French-Jewish identity and mode of writing; and the threat of fascism and the approach of the Second World War. </P>

The volume provides a broad-ranging assessment of the causes, complexities, and consequences of America’s most destructive conflict to date.

One common student response is that organizational behavior is nothing more than common sense.

92c338214e2ccbe61f01e446c773c697	Pro Dynamic .NET 4.0 Applications: Data-Driven Programming for the .NET Framework	Carl Ganz	2010	Apress	1	350	143022519X	English	<p> As a developer you are likely painfully aware that not all features of an application can be anticipated when the software ships. In order to cope with these eventualities and save yourself time (and perhaps money), it makes sense to write your applications in such a way that end users can be made as independent of the developers as possible. Giving your users the power to make changes to the way the application operates once it has shipped gives them more control over the way the application works, while reducing the frequency with which you need to redistribute application files, creating a win-win situation.     </p>    <p> This book explains how to give users the power to create additional data-entry fields, validation logic, and new reports without assistance from the application developer. You will learn how to do this for both desktop (C# and WPF) and web (ASP) applications.</p>    <br/>    <h3>What you'll learn</h3>    <ul>    	<li>How to allow the user to create validation logic at runtime</li>    	<li>How to define and instantiate controls at runtime and the pitfalls of doing so</li>    	<li>How to create data-driven reports using Excel, Crystal Reports, and SQL Server Reporting Services </li>    	<li>How to design a database structure for optimizing data-driven applications</li>    	<li>How to build a user interface that allows users to modify their application visually</li>            </ul>    <br/>    <h3>Who is this book for?</h3>        <p>This book is for anyone wanting to distribute an application in which the user needs to be as independent of the developer as possible. By using the techniques described in the book, the user will have the power to make modifications to his own applications, and the developer will reduce the frequency with which he needs to redistribute EXEs.</p>                <h3>About the Apress Pro Series</h3>        <p>The Apress Pro series books are practical, professional tutorials to keep you on and moving up the professional ladder.</p>        <p>You have gotten the job, now you need to hone your skills in these tough competitive times.

Rails is a new approach to web-based application development that enables developers to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications using less code and less effort. Now programmers can get the job done right and still leave work on time. <p> NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION: The book has been updated to take advantage of all the new Rails 1.2 features. The sample application uses migrations, Ajax, features a REST interface, and illustrates new Rails features. There are new chapters on migrations, active support, active record, and action controller (including the new resources-based routing). The Web 2.0 and Deployment chapters have been completely rewritten to reflect the latest thinking. Now you can learn which environments are best for your style application, and see how Capistrano makes managing your site simple. All the remaining chapters have been extensively updated. Finally, hundreds of comments from readers of the first edition have been incorporated, making this book simply the best available. <p> Rails is a full-stack, open source web framework that enables you to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications with a twist...you can create a full Rails application using less code than the setup XML you'd need just to configure some other frameworks. <p> With this book, you'll learn how to use Rails Active Record to connect business objects and database tables.  No more painful object-relational mapping.  Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest.  You'll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, talk to web services, and interact dynamically with JavaScript applications running in the browser (the "Ajax" architecture).<br> <p> You'll see how easy it is to deploy Rails.  You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all.</p></div>	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KxXNu8g3L.jpg

But today's game players have  grown in sophistication along with the games they play. It's  no longer enough to wow your players with dazzling graphics;  the next step in creating even more immersive games is  improved artificial intelligence, or AI.      <P>Fortunately, advanced AI game techniques are within the  grasp of every game developer--not just those who dedicate  their careers to AI. If you're new to game programming or if  you're an experienced game programmer who needs to get up to  speed quickly on AI techniques, you'll find AI for Game  Developers to be the perfect starting point for  understanding and applying AI techniques to your games.      <P>Written for the novice AI programmer, AI for Game Developers  introduces you to techniques such as finite state machines,  fuzzy logic, neural networks, and many others, in  straightforward, easy-to-understand language, supported with  code samples throughout the entire book (written in C/C++).  From basic techniques such as chasing and evading, pattern  movement, and flocking to genetic algorithms, the book  presents a mix of deterministic (traditional) and  non-deterministic (newer) AI techniques aimed squarely at  beginners AI developers. Other topics covered in the book  include:  Potential function based movements: a technique that handles  chasing, evading swarming, and collision avoidance  simultaneously  Basic pathfinding and waypoints, including an entire chapter  devoted to the A* pathfinding algorithm  AI scripting  Rule-based AI: learn about variants other than fuzzy logic  and finite state machines  Basic probability  Bayesian techniques  Unlike other books on the subject, AI for Game Developers  doesn't attempt to cover every aspect of game AI, but to  provide you with usable, advanced techniques you can apply  to your games right now.  If you've wanted to use AI to  extend the play-life of your games, make them more  challenging, and most importantly, make them more fun, then  this book is for you.	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414WBHC5DNL.jpg

Here she presents the authentic principles in a technical, no-nonsense pocket book specifically for architects.<br><br>  As clients become more demanding and the competition for projects heats up, the architect is well advised to have many strings to their bow. This practical guide includes line illustrations that present the principles of feng shui, the Chinese art or practice in which a structure or site is chosen or configured so as to harmonize with the spiritual forces that inhabit it, and their application in architecture through planning principles, services, building elements and materials, in an accessible, easy reference format. The feng shui-savvy architect can also benefit from feng shui's ability to match structures and land, and the peculiar capacity of authentic feng shui to forecast development-related concerns including cost overruns, quality issues - even worker injuries and trade disputes!<br><br>The author explains feng shui from archaeological sources and evidence of practice in the east, contrasting it with what passes for feng shui in the west. She analyses the practice in terms of such concepts as western systems theory, viewshed, space syntax and the 'pattern landscape' theory of urban planning. For the first time, the Sustainable implications of feng shui design are explained with reference to the latest developments in behavioural and cognitve sciences, evolutionary biology and other western viewpoints.                                       <br><br>* The first 'how to' guide on feng shui specifically written for architects<br>* Contains numerous technical illustrations to define and analyse the genuine design elements of feng shui, for quick and easy reference<br>* Supplies knowledge of the scientific, ethical and ecological principles of the original Chinese system, to impress your clients	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xL6oKyOWL.jpg

The sketches date from a crucial period in the young man's development, spanning his highly successful student years and the beginnings of his professional career. Each of the three sketchbooks covers an area central to his growth as an artist: the architecture of his native Scotland, an important scholarship journey in Italy and, Mackintosh's first love and greatest influence, the study of plants and growing things. <br><br>Essentially private, these little known and unique works provide privileged access to significant moments in the artist's intellectual and emotional life. In this book Elaine Grogan attempts to take them out of the library display-case and bring them to life in the hands of the reader. She invites us to look over Mackintosh's shoulder on his early tentative steps towards fulfilment as a creative genius. Connections are traced, both backwards in time to his training and forwards to his great successes and eventual bitter eclipse. <br>                                       <br><br>* Gain a new understanding of a crucial period in Charles Rennie Mackintosh's development through these unpublished sketches<br>* Connect his sketch books of Scotland, Italy and botany to later great works<br>* Be inspired by these private, yet significant sketches	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61GNZKpdqUL.jpg

The new edition brings the book up to date on C# features added in the C# 2.0 version that ships with Microsoft's new Visual Studio 2005. The book's friendly, conversational approach brings C# and new features like generics and iterators down to earth "for the rest of us." Readers with little or no programming experience can get a good start here. Readers with more experience will find this a congenial way to acquire a fine new language. Virtually every page of the original book has been updated or sometimes replaced to give you the latest cool stuff.  Earlier versions of C# gave us "collections"--objects for storing lots of similar things. Now, C# 2.0 gives us the ability to write our own collections using generic constructs. Explore generics by helping OOPs, Inc., compete with its rival package shippers using their new generic priority queue collection. In C# 1.0, you could write your own iterator--an object that makes it easy to loop through a collection item by item. Now, C# 2.0 makes writing iterators much, much easier. Explore iterators by iterating anything that will hold still long enough. <I>C# 2005 for Dummies</I> thoroughly covers generics, iterators, and other new C# features and introduces many new features of Microsoft Visual Studio.  As a bonus, you get tons of sample programs, five extra chapters, including one on using "C# on the Cheap," plus three nifty, valuable utility programs you can install and use for your own programming. And, to accompany and supplement <I>C# 2005 for Dummies</I>, there's a new Web site at CSharp102.com and a companion blog at CSharp102.blogspot.com.

So, how can you prevent break-ins to your system if you don’t know how they are accomplished? How do you test your security measures? How do you make a judgment about how secure a new system is?  <P>When you’re through reading Hack Proofing Your Network, you’ll understand terms like “smashing the stack,” “blind spoofing,” “building a backward bridge,” “steganography,” “buffer overflow” and you’ll see why you need to worry about them.

Demand for security for wireless networks will  drive the growth of the information security services  market. Announcements by major companies (i.e. Intel, Dell, Gateway,  IBM) backing wireless technologies are setting the stage for  wide-scale deployments and the ushering in a new era of wireless  freedom. The bottom line is that wireless is here to stay. The  integration of 802.11 into almost all new laptops, coupled with the  explosion in availability of public hotspots has created a cycle of  large scale wireless proliferation. This invisible, yet inescapable  flood of radio waves has landed squarely in our homes and businesses  where it presents a new security challenge. How do we embrace the joys  of wireless networks while we maintain an essential balance with  the security needs of our organization? This book is all about  understanding the technology, recognizing the security risks, and  implementing a responsible and realistic game plan for safe and secure  wireless communication.	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FM0ZBHHRL.jpg

This great scientific and human drama is the story told fully and for the first time in this book.  </p><p>  Acclaimed science writer James Schwartz presents the history of genetics through the eyes of a dozen or so central players, beginning with Charles Darwin and ending with Nobel laureate Hermann J. Muller. In tracing the emerging idea of the gene, Schwartz deconstructs many often-told stories that were meant to reflect glory on the participants and finds that the “official” version of discovery often hides a far more complex and illuminating narrative. The discovery of the structure of DNA and the more recent advances in genome science represent the culmination of one hundred years of concentrated inquiry into the nature of the gene. Schwartz’s multifaceted training as a mathematician, geneticist, and writer enables him to provide a remarkably lucid account of the development of the central ideas about heredity, and at the same time bring to life the brilliant and often eccentric individuals who shaped these ideas.  </p><p>  In the spirit of the late Stephen Jay Gould, this book offers a thoroughly engaging story about one of the oldest and most controversial fields of scientific inquiry. It offers readers the background they need to understand the latest findings in genetics and those still to come in the search for the genetic basis of complex diseases and traits.  </p> (20080517)	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41daBuYMVjL.jpg

IPv6 socket APIs (RFC2553) are fully described with real-world examples. It covers security, a great concern these days. To secure the Internet infrastructure, every developer has to take a security stance - to audit every line of code, to use proper API and write correct and secure code as much as possible.  To achieve this goal, the examples presented in this book are implemented with a security stance.  Also, the book leads you to write secure programs.  For instance, the book recommends against the use of some of the IPv6 standard APIs - unfortunately, there are some IPv6 APIs that are inherently insecure, so the book tries to avoid (and discourage) the use of such APIs. Another key issue is portability. The examples in the book should be applicable to any of UNIX based operating systems, MacOS X, and Windows XP.                                       <br><br>* Covers the new protocol just adopted by the Dept of Defense for future systems<br>* Deals with security concerns, including spam and email, by presenting the best programming standards <br>* Fully describes IPv6 socket APIs (RFC2553) using real-world examples <br>* Allows for portability to UNIX-based operating systems, MacOS X, and Windows XP	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xzXGAb8wL.jpg

Such a publisher would (and we know one who does) use iText for the task. Developers looking to enhance web- and other applications with dynamic PDF document generation and/or manipulation will find this book unique in content <i>and</i> readability. Based on ongoing examples that encourage learning "in action," they will finally understand PDF and learn how to build applications that produce professional, high-quality PDF documents. While the basic functionality of iText is easy to acquire, this book lowers the learning curve for more advanced functionality. It explains how to use iText to create/manipulate PDF documents on-the-fly in one or more of the following situations: <p> Due to time or size, the PDF documents can't be produced manually The content of the document must be calculated or based on user input. The content needs to be customized or personalized. The PDF content needs to be served in a web environment. Documents are to be created in "batch process" mode. <p> All the examples are written in Java, but they can be easily adapted to .NET by developers using one of the .NET ports: iTextSharp (C#) or iText.NET (#J). While iText is a free Java library and the examples are written from the point of view of the Java developer, nine out of ten examples can be run by .NET developers with only minimal changes.</p></div>	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FHvHkK63L.jpg

Most people  never progress beyond creating simple tables and using wizards to build  basic forms and reports. At the same time, you need information and you  know that what you seek is embedded somewhere in your Access  database.  Without a more sophisticated knowledge of how to  extract and present that data, you’re forced to rely on office gurus  and overworked IT people to provide canned reports or one-size-fits-all  solutions.</p> <p style="margin: 0px;"> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">This  book changes all that by giving you the skills to build efficient  front-ends for data (forms), publish the results in an attractive and  easy-to-read format (reports), and extract the data you need (queries).  This book shuns the big Access picture and instead focuses intently on  forms, reports, and queries. This in-depth approach will give you the  knowledge and understanding you need to get at the data and prove the  old saw that knowledge is power.</p> <p style="margin: 0px;">·         Focuses on the three technologies that you must master to get the most  out of Access: forms, reports, and queries.</p> <p style="margin: 0px;">·         Avoids database theory in favor of practical know-how that you can put  to use right away.</p> <p style="margin: 0px;">·         Packed full of real-world examples and techniques to help you learn and  understand the importance of each section.</p> <p style="margin: 0px;">·        Covers what’s new and changed in Microsoft Access 2007.</p> <p style="margin: 0px;"> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Introduction <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Part I: Creating Forms <b><br> </b></p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 1         Creating and Using a Form <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 2         Working with Form Controls <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 3         Designing Forms for Efficient and Accurate Data Entry <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 4         Designing Forms for Business Use <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 5         Creating Specialized Forms <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Part II: Designing and Customizing Reports <b><br> </b></p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 6         Creating and Publishing a Report <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 7         Designing Effective Business Reports <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 8         Designing Advanced Reports <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 9         Creating Specialized Reports <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Part III: Creating Powerful Queries <b><br> </b></p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 10       Creating a Basic Query <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 11       Building Criteria Expressions <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 12       Working with Multiple-Table Queries <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 13       Creating Advanced Queries <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 14       Creating PivotTable Queries <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Chapter 15       Querying with SQL Statements <br> </p> <p style="margin: 0px;">Index <br> </p>	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O9RApazFL.jpg

Learning ActionScript 3.0 gives you a solid foundation in the language of Flash and demonstrates how you can use it for practical, everyday projects.The authors do more than just give you a collection of sample scripts. Written for those of you new to ActionScript 3.0, the book describes how ActionScript and Flash work, giving you a clear look into essential topics such as logic, event handling, displaying content, migrating legacy projects to ActionScript 3.0, classes, and much more.

b34cb764a2400c02f4f90da3290c0306	New Homelands: Hindu Communities in Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, South Africa, Fiji, and East Africa	Paul Younger	2009	Oxford University Press, USA		304	0195391640	English	When the colonial slave trade, and then slavery itself, were abolished early in the 19th century, the British empire brazenly set up a new system of trade using Indian rather than African laborers. The new system of "indentured" labor was supposed to be different from slavery because the indenture, or contract, was written for an initial period of five years and involved fixed wages and some specified conditions of work. From the workers' point of view, the one redeeming feature of the system was that most of their workmates spoke their language and came from the same area of India. Because this allowed them to develop some sense of community, by the end of the initial five years most of the Indian laborers chose to stay in the land to which they had been taken. In time that land became the place in which they joined with others to build a new homeland. In this fieldwork-based study, Paul Younger looks at the present day descendents of these workers and their post-indenture societies in Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, South Africa, Fiji, and East Africa. He finds that they still cling to the fact that it was an arbitrary British decision that took them there and made the society pluralistic. This plurality seems to require them to search their memory for a distinctive religious tradition that they can pass on to their children. They know that there was a loss of culture involved in their move to these locations and consider it important to recover from that loss. But they are also intensely proud of their new identity, and insist that they have established a new religious tradition in their new homeland. For generations, says Younger, these people had struggled in their situation and now they had come up with a sense of community and purpose and were prepared to make the historical claim that they had developed an appropriate religious tradition for their specific community.	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IlSItuV6L.jpg
70a9a36de36f25b8ce57e2f2f65352a1	The Myth of Southern Exceptionalism		2009	Oxford University Press, USA		360	0195384741	English	More than one-third of the population of the United States now lives in the South, a region where politics, race relations, and the economy have changed dramatically since World War II. Yet historians and journalists continue to disagree over whether the modern South is dominating, deviating from, or converging with the rest of the nation. Has the time come to declare the end of southern history? And how do the stories of American history change if the South is no longer seen as a region apart--as the conservative counterpoint to a liberal national ideal? <br> <br> <em>The Myth of Southern Exceptionalism</em> challenges the idea of southern distinctiveness in order to offer a new way of thinking about modern American history. For too long, the belief in an exceptional South has encouraged distortions and generalizations about the nation's otherwise liberal traditions, especially by compartmentalizing themes of racism, segregation, and political conservatism in one section of the country. This volume dismantles popular binaries--of de facto versus de jure segregation, red state conservatism versus blue state liberalism, the "South" versus the "North"--to rewrite the history of region and nation alike. <br> <br> Matthew Lassiter and Joseph Crespino present thirteen essays--framed by their provocative introduction--that reinterpret major topics such as the civil rights movement in the South and the North, the relationship between conservative backlash and liberal reform throughout the country, the rise of the Religious Right as a national phenomenon, the emergence of the metropolitan Sunbelt, and increasing suburban diversity in a multiracial New South. By writing American history across regional borders, this volume spends as much time outside as inside the traditional boundaries of the South, moving from Mississippi to New York City, from Southern California to South Carolina, from Mexico to Atlanta, from Hollywood to the Newport Folk Festival, and from the Pentagon to the Attica prison rebellion.	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3142mxhCrqL.jpg
1cb67f554e3706e460481195988c88ac	Learning Jakarta Struts 1.2: a concise and practical tutorial: A step-by-step introduction to building Struts web applications for Java developers	Stephan Wiesner	2005	Packt Publishing		220	190481154X	English	<P>A step-by-step introduction to building Struts web applications for Java developers </p>  <ul> <li>Learn to build Struts applications right away </li><li>Build an ecommerce store step-by-step using Struts </li><li>Well-structured and logical progression through the essentials </li></ul>  <P><b>In Detail</b></p>  <P>Jakarta Struts is an Open Source Java framework for developing web applications. By cleanly separating logic and presentation, Struts makes applications more manageable and maintainable.<br>  Since its donation to the Apache Foundation  in 2001, Struts has been rapidly accepted as the leading Java web application framework, and community support and development is well established.</p>  <P>Struts-based web sites are built from the ground up to be easily modifiable and maintainable, and internationalization and flexibility of design are deeply rooted. Struts uses the Model-View-Controller design pattern to enforce a strict separation between processing logic and presentation logic, and enables efficient object re-use.</p>  <P>The book is written as a structured tutorial, with each chapter building on the last. The book begins by introducing the architecture of a Struts application in terms of the Model-View-Controller pattern. Having explained how to install Jakarta and Struts, the book then goes straight into an initial implementation of the book store. The well structured code of the book store application is explained and related simply to the architectural issues.</p>  <P> Custom Actions, internationalization and the possibilities offered by Taglibs are covered early to illustrate the power and flexibility inherent in the framework. The bookstore application is then enhanced in functionality and quality through the addition of logging and configuration data, and well-crafted forms. At each stage of enhancement, the design issues are laid out succinctly, then the practical implementation explained clearly. This combination of theory and practical example lays a solid understanding of both the principles and the practice of building Struts applications.</p>    <P><b>What you will learn from this book?</b></p>  <ul> <li>Understand the Model-View-Controller architecture and how it is implemented in Struts     </li><li>How to start building an application with Struts </li><li>How to produce well-crafted and robust applications using sound software engineering practices </li><li>How to build a complete application, in this case a web bookstore </li></ul><br>          <P><b>Approach</b></p>  <P>The book sets out to get Java developers up to speed and confident with Struts as quickly as possible. It does not explain every feature in Struts, but takes a logical path through the essential information, with the emphasis on practical applications. </p>       <P><b>Who this book is written for?</b></p>  <P> This book is written for Java developers planning to develop web applications, who are new to Struts. It expects familiarity with Java, JSP and Servlets to a degree, although more obscure elements are explained.  It covers Struts 1.2. </p>	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51InrSNcKPL.jpg

As in the Old World, kings and nobles of ancient Mexico and Peru had luxurious administrative quarters in cities, and exquisite pleasure palaces in the countryside. This volume explores the great houses of the ancient New World, from palaces of the Aztecs and Incas, looted by the Spanish conquistadors, to those lost high in the Andes and deep in the jungle. This volume, the first scholarly compendium of elite residences of the high cultures of the New World, presents definitive descriptions and interpretations by leading scholars in the field. Authoritative yet accessible, this extensively illustrated book will serve as an important resource for anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians of art, architecture, and related disciplines.	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ep1FEdO2L.jpg

The long-running debate on the subject has not only played a major part in the downfall of prime ministers and other leading political figures but has also exposed major fault-lines within governments and caused deep and rancorous divisions within and between the major political parties. This highly contested issue has given rise to bitter campaigning in the press and between pressure groups, and it has bemused, confused and divided the public at large. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Key questions addressed include:</P>  <P></P>  <UL>  <P>  <LI>Why has Europe had such an explosive impact on British politics?</LI>  <P></P>  <P>  <LI>What impelled British policymakers to join the European Community and to undertake one of the radical, if not the most radical, changes in modern British history?</LI>  <P></P>  <P>  <LI>What have been the perceived advantages and disadvantages of British membership of the European Union?</LI>  <P></P>  <P>  <LI>Why has British membership of the European Union rarely attracted a national consensus?</LI>  <P></P></UL>  <P>Engaging with both academic and public debates about Britain and the European Union, this volume is essential reading for all students of British history, British politics, and European politics.</P>	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V2gXQ3kwL.jpg

Science and General Issues) (German Edition)	Mumtaz Siddiqui	2010	Springer	1st Edition.	227	3642115780	German	<P>In a dynamic computing environment, such as the Grid, resource management plays a crucial role for making distributed resources available on-demand to anyone from anywhere at any time without undermining the resource autonomy; this becomes an art when dealing with heterogeneous resources distributed under multiple trust domains spanning across the Internet. Today Grid execution environments provide abstract workflow descriptions that need a dynamic mapping to actual deployments; this further accentuates the importance of resource management in the Grid.</P>  <P>This monograph renders boundaries of the Grid resource management, identifies research challenges and proposes new solutions with innovative techniques for on-demand provisioning, automatic deployments, dynamic synthesis, negotiation-based advance reservation and capacity planning of Grid resources. The Grid capacity planning is performed with multi-constrained optimized resource allocations by modelling resource allocation as an on-line strip packing problem and introducing a new solution that optimizes resource utilization and QoS while generating contention-free solutions.</P>  <P>On-demand resource provisioning becomes possible by simplifying abstract resource descriptions independent from the concrete installations. The book further explains the use of the semantic web technologies in the Grid to specify explicit definitions and unambiguous machine interpretable resource descriptions for intelligent resource matching and synthesis; the synthesis process generates new compound resources with aggregated capabilities and prowess. The newly introduced techniques haven been developed and integrated in ASKALON Grid application development and runtime environment, deployed in the Austrian Grid, and demonstrated through well performed experiments.</P>

Generations of researchers have investigated one of the last remaining evolutionary paradoxes: why sex exists at all. Given that sexual reproduction is costly from an evolutionary point of view, one could wonder why not all animals and plants reproduce asexually. Dozens of contemporary hypotheses attempt to explain the prevalence of sex and its advantages and predict the early extinction of fully asexual lineages. </P>  <P>The major theme of this book is: what is the fate of animal and plant groups in which sex is lost? Initial chapters discuss theory behind asexual life: what major disadvantages do asexual groups have to face, what are the genetic and ecological consequences and what does this theory predict for more applied aspects of asexual life, for example in agricultural pests, diseases as well as in cultural crops such as grapes. Cases studies in many animals (focusing on both invertebrates and vertebrates) and plants reveal parallel, but also singularly novel adaptations to the absence of meiosis and syngamy. And last but not least, are asexuals really doomed to early extinction or do genuine ancient asexuals exist? </P>  <P>This book assembles contributions from the most important research groups dealing with asexual evolution in eukaryotes. It is a milestone in research on parthenogenesis and will be useful to undergraduate as well as graduate students and to senior researchers in all fields of evolutionary biology, as the paradox of sex remains its queen of problems. </P>	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NHNdz8uyL.jpg
d6df52bb840eb61f2021231d9b0c3d00	From Innate Immunity to Immunological Memory (Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology)		2006	Springer	1	184	3540326359	English	<P>The ability to remember an antigenic encounter for several decades, even for a life time, is one of the fundamental properties of the immune system. This phenomenon known as "immunological memory," is the foundation upon which the concept if vaccination rests. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which immunological memory is regulated is of paramount importance. Recent advances in immunology, particularly in the field of innate immunity, suggest that the innate immune system plays fundamental roles in influencing immunological memory. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that events that occur early, within hours if not minutes of pathogen or vaccine entry profoundly shape the quantity, quality and duration of immunological memory. The present volume assembles a collection of essays from leading experts that span the entire spectrum research from understanding the molecular mechanisms of innate immune recognition, to dendritic cell function, to the generation and maintenance of antigen-specific B and T-cell responses. </P>	http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414%2BXxnbjfL.jpg

The new edition brings the book up to date on C# features added in the C# 2.0 version that ships with Microsoft's new Visual Studio 2005. The book's friendly, conversational approach brings C# and new features like generics and iterators down to earth "for the rest of us." Readers with little or no programming experience can get a good start here. Readers with more experience will find this a congenial way to acquire a fine new language. Virtually every page of the original book has been updated or sometimes replaced to give you the latest cool stuff.  Earlier versions of C# gave us "collections"--objects for storing lots of similar things. Now, C# 2.0 gives us the ability to write our own collections using generic constructs. Explore generics by helping OOPs, Inc., compete with its rival package shippers using their new generic priority queue collection. In C# 1.0, you could write your own iterator--an object that makes it easy to loop through a collection item by item. Now, C# 2.0 makes writing iterators much, much easier. Explore iterators by iterating anything that will hold still long enough. <I>C# 2005 for Dummies</I> thoroughly covers generics, iterators, and other new C# features and introduces many new features of Microsoft Visual Studio.  As a bonus, you get tons of sample programs, five extra chapters, including one on using "C# on the Cheap," plus three nifty, valuable utility programs you can install and use for your own programming.
